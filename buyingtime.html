                    <h1 class="title">Buying Time</h1>
                    <p>Over seven months, I worked with a client to the reimagine the business interactions between retail buyers and their wholesale suppliers. We prototyped a service oriented platform that makes retail buying visual, consolidated, and collaborative.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">How did that shirt you’re wearing make its way to the store?</h3>

                    <p> Every day retail buyers plan, source, and purchase of a range of products on behalf of a retailer that determines what is available to you, the consumer. The cumulative decisions of a retail buyer can account for millions of dollars in purchases per year and directly affects the success of their company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, before the products ever make it onto the shelves, buyers collect and manage a dizzying array of emails, attachments, phone calls, and meetings to collaborate with wholesale organizations.<strong> Our challenge was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the retail buyer’s interaction with their wholesale supplier counterparts.</strong> </p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Uncovering the Problems</h3>

                    <p>I created our research field guide as a system of research activities to understand and connect a wide range of stakeholders’ needs and values. From interviews about <i>why</i> divisional merchandising manager care about sell-through rates, to a contextual inquiry into <i>how</i> products are negotiated during high profile New York meetings, to analysing <i>what</i> an assistant buyer does every monday before lunch. </p>

                        <p><strong>Research and Synthesis.</strong> I lead the user research and systematically aligned our evidence, models, and insights. I wrote and coded our digital materials and co-wrote our print materials. </p>
                        <p><strong>Business Strategy.</strong> I advocated for a high-touch, curated experience as the sustainable competitive advantage that allowed our prototypes to develop into a successful business. </p>
                        <p><strong>Values, Benefits, and Features.</strong> I co-wrote the user stories that defined the workflow and scope of our final prototypes. </p>
                        <p><strong>Misc.</strong> I stood at the whiteboard often and drew a lot of words, arrows, and boxes. </p>
