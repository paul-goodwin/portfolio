                    <p>Over seven months, I worked with a client to the reimagine the business interactions between retail buyers and their wholesale suppliers. We prototyped a service oriented platform that makes retail buying visual, consolidated, and collaborative.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">How did that shirt you’re wearing make its way to the store?</h3>

                    <p> Every day retail buyers plan, source, and purchase of a range of products on behalf of a retailer that determines what is available to you, the consumer. The cumulative decisions of a retail buyer can account for millions of dollars in purchases per year and directly affects the success of their company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, before the products ever make it onto the shelves, buyers collect and manage a dizzying array of emails, attachments, phone calls, and meetings to collaborate with wholesale organizations.<strong> Our challenge was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the retail buyer’s interaction with their wholesale supplier counterparts.</strong> </p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Uncovering the Problems</h3>

                    <p>I created our research field guide as a system of research activities to understand and connect a wide range of stakeholders’ needs and values. From interviews about <i>why</i> divisional merchandising manager care about sell-through rates, to a contextual inquiry into <i>how</i> products are negotiated during high profile New York meetings, to analysing <i>what</i> an assistant buyer does every monday before lunch. We captured and synthesised a wide range of activities that make up the buyer's role.</p> <br>

                                    To ensure Buying Time reflects how buying is done in practice, we immersed ourselves in the daily work of several buyers, including actual New York buying meetings.

                                    Competitive analysis of 20 current industry tools. We conducted 50+ semi-structured interviews with buyer and vendors throughout our process to test our assumptions and account for industry diversity.

                                    We tested buyers' and suppliers' attitudes towards communication tools with a 1-minute flashcard exercise between the floors of a trade while they were trapped in an elevator with us.

                    <p>We captured the wove the details gathered from our research together using a modified affinity diagramming technique that used colour to highlight user roles. These colours allowed us to see clusters of user needs begin to form. We used this information to construct flow diagrams, cultural models, personas, flow, and later as supporting evidence for the business and user value of delivered by our prototype.</p>
