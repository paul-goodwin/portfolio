                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Lead UX researcher.</strong> I systematically aligned our evidence, models, and insights. I co-wrote our <a href="media/web-report/LhVentures_MHCI_Research.pdf">research</a> and <a href="media/web-report/LhVentures_MCHI_Design.pdf">design</a> reports to communicate our insights. I worked closely with buyers and suppliers to iteratively test and improve BuyingTime.</p>
                    <p><strong>Business Strategist.</strong> I translated our insights into sustainable competitive advantages. I designed and coded our <a href="media/web-report/index.html">product website</a> to communicate the benefits of BuyingTime. I worked with our CEO to keep users at the core of our vision and deliver on our brand promises.</p>
                    <p><strong>Product Leader.</strong> I co-wrote user stories and defined the scope of our prototype—designing workflows, wireframes, and requirements for the full enterprise web platform. </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Designer.</strong> I designed the navigation and UI components, and pieced them into interactive mockups used by the development team.

                    <h3 class="title">Create a seamless buying experience in 7 months</h3>
                    <p>Everday, retail buyers plan, source, and purchase the products that you see on the shelves. The cumulative decisions of a single retail buyer can account for millions in annual revenue and directly affect the success of their company.</p>
                    <p>But before the products ever make it onto the shelves, buyers wade through a dizzying array of emails, spreadsheets, phone calls, and meetings to collaborate with wholesalers. This process is inefficient and frustrating for buyers across the board.

                        <strong>We set out to energize the relationship between retail buyers and their wholesale suppliers.</strong> </p><br>

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Learning the industry</h3>

                    <p> As the research lead for our team, I knew that we didn't have the vocabulary to meaningfully interact with buyers. Our team had to show up to buyer meetings and talk the talk. I facilitated teach-back sessions to get up to speed on a jargon-heavy industry.
                    </p><br>

                    <br>

                    <p>Next, our competitive analysis revealed a pattern: buyers rely on heavily-siloed systems. Our secondary research uncovered a succinct summary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">why that might be</a>: organizations tend to design software specific to their own needs and communication structures. When companies need to work together, this becaomes a large problem. And to make matters worse, <a href="https://hbr.org/1983/09/purchasing-must-become-supply-management">power dynamics</a> in the retail industry make it hard to have standard, collaborative tools. Every retailer wants to work with their supply chain differently. </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Uncovering the problems</h3>
                    <p>There are many working relationships in the retail industry, both internally and between companies. One retail manager I spoke to had worked with the same seller for over 20 years! I created research activities that covered the breadth of industry roles while going in-depth on the buyer-supplier relationship. To uncover <i>why</i>, I collected and analysed how buyers talk about their "best buy" to understand their motives(interestingly, every buyer has a "best buy" story ready to go at a moments notice). To understand <i>how</i> products are negotiated I observed high-profile sales meetings during a contextual inquiry. To dissect <i>what</i> makes a great relationship, I asked everyone from managers to new hires about their closest inter-company partners.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also encouraged experimental research activities to supplement the more traditional research methods. I designed an empathy-building activity that highlighted the frustration and pressure buyers expereince trying to stay on trend and hit sales meterics with incomplete information.

Where scale makes it difficult for these relationships to directly connect, technology can renew the connection. But the technology they have is about the numbers, and the technology they need is about the relationships. </p>
                    <p>To bring the buyer's relationships to the forefront of our designs, we wanted to make the buying experience more visual, collaborative, and fun. To capture the design direction, our team summarized our findings into four insights: </p>

                    <p>After the research phase, I led the team and our client through a series of branding and value proposition exercises to find the core values that connected our user's needs (demand) and our clients interest in devloping our work into a business within a year (viability), and the 8 weeks we had remining to create and test a full prototype (feasibility). [This paragraph could be cool as a diagram...]</p>

                    <p>While trying to build consensus around a value proposition, I revisited one of our fundamental questions: why do buyers work with suppliers at all? The really short answer: buyers have to review tens of thousands of products a year, so they rely on their suppilers to be partners, guides, and experts on the specifics of the products they sell. The best suppliers anticipate their buyers' needs to make their lives easier. </p>
                    <p>I started to conceptualize our prototype as a a service platform. I realized we weren't in the best position to help buyers, suppliers were. Rather than trying to design a tool for buyers, we envisioned a platform that allows them get more value from their existing supplier relationships.<strong> We pivoted from directly helping buyers to helping suppliers help buyers. </strong> </p>

                    <p>We created a platform that connects and aligns everyone in the sales cycle, from retail department managers to sales reps. We focused our prototype on the idea that buyers could "give a little and get a lot". Unlike other software in the market, we made it easy for buyers to organize and express their needs internally and externally to their supplier network. This structure makes the buying process visual, organized, and connected in real time. For a full breakdown of the features and benefits of our prototypes, check out our design report.[I would de-emphasize the fact that this was a prototype with the capstone team, and more on the fact that is was getting developed. E.g. public website vs. design report.]</p><br>

                    <p>Creating BuyingTime was the perfect example of human-centered design creating business value. I successfully ensured our client's interest in creating a business shaped and was shaped by our design process. By systemically aligning our research and designs to deliver value to both buyers and suppliers, we have created a novel service platform prototype that users are excited to try. And by thinking critically about the whole buying ecosystem, we have created a road map for how our client can grow prototype in the future. {these were particularly useful as a joined LH Venutures to evelove our prototype into a full B2B platform, and go to market.} </p><br>

                    <p>In October 2016, I joined LH Ventures as employee #3 to evolve our vision into a full-scale B2B platform. Since I was working almost 100% remotely on a newly formed team, I took a lead role in trying out different collaboration tools and processes to help us find our stride.</p>

                    <p>Working in a startup with only a handful of people, I took on most product-related roles. From the big picture to the detailed interactions, I took on the challenge and responsibility to continuously align design choices to deliver on our brand promises with every design. </p>

                    <p>While I can't go into detail on every desigh, I’d like to focus on a specific, but typical design challenge that I feel illustrate my approach to strategy and design.</p>

                    <p>Products are the basic unit of the buying process, and by extension, BuyingTime. As such, one of my early design challenges was how to represent products across our platform—How I could best representing products to helps buyers triage tens of thousands of products a year quickly and confidently?
                    </p>
                    <p>I started problem solving by examining how products on popular ecommerce platforms to get many perspectives. I collected and summarized a library of these representations and tallied the different types of product information included on each. I sketched card designs with different amounts of information and evaluated their strengths and weaknesses with buyers. </p>

                    <p>The testing quickly revealed that difference between retail buying and consumer buying meant that most of my designs based on consumer ecommerce were missing the mark (one surprising example—price is a secondary concern for retail buyers because many complex logistic factors make the list price less useful). I moved buyers responses onto post-it notes, grouped them by affinity, and synthesised a core user need: “I only want to see details for products that I care about”.</p>
                    <p> Since ecommerce wasn’t proving to be an analogous domain, I started looking to other disciplines for a model that would help me get the right information on the product cards at the right time. </p>

                    <p>Drawing on previous branding experience, I adapted a marketing communication model (AIDA) and used it to clarify what information and interactions were needed different stages in the purchasing process.</p>

                        <strong>Product Card </strong>- minimal information, focus on catching attention with images

                        I quickly blocked out the product representations to map the function and information content that would be needed depending on user role and other contextual factors. I used this as a tool to talk about a repeatable structure of the cards with the development team without getting bogged down in the details.

                        After applying this model throughout our platform, I tested the product interactions and workflows and found that buyers were excited to review products using our platform. I similarly deployed skills in problem solving, strategy, and empathy to create experiences across our platform for our navigation, user roles, permissions, bulk data and media manipulation, intercompany messaging, revision tracking, and more. Taken together, these designs have built up to deliver significant value to both supplier and retail partners. In fact, <strong>we are currently in active beta with a supplier and a billion dollar retail client.</strong> </p>

                        Being solely responsible many foundational concepts and designs was a great experience, but equally challenged me to seek out feedback and actively listen to, and check my biases with, users and colleagues. I worked closely with every team member, shifting between leading and supporting roles to make sure we hit our release goals or when priorities shifted. Finally, using human-centered design methods I helped shape and deliver on a brand promise that has excited almost every user I've had the oppertunity to interact with.</p>
