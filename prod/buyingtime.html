                    <p> Over seven months at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU, MHCI program) I was part of a team working with a client—LH Ventures (LHV)—to reimagine the business interactions between retail buyers and their wholesale suppliers. We prototyped a service oriented platform that makes retail buying visual, consolidated, and collaborative. I joined LHV to continue to develop our concepts into a successful startup currently launching with a billion dollar retailer client.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle is-7 pretitle"> Challenge #1</h3>
                    <h3 class="title is-">Reimagine entrenched B2B relationships in 7 months</h3>

                    <p> Every day retail buyers plan, source, and purchase of a range of products on behalf of a retailer that determines what is available to you, the consumer. The cumulative decisions of a single retail buyer can account for millions of dollars in purchases per year and directly affects the success of their company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, before the products ever make it onto the shelves, buyers encounter a dizzying array of emails, attachments, phone calls, and meetings to collaborate with wholesale organizations. This process was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for buyers across the board.

                        <strong> Our challenge was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the retail buyer’s interaction with their wholesale supplier counterparts.</strong> </p><br>

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Laying the ground work</h3>
                    <p>Business-to-business tools are too often created by one business and imposed on another. To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's Law</a>: organizations tend to design software that specific to their own needs and communication structures. Our initial stakeholder interviews showed both retail and supplier organizations had many complex and feature rich systems customized for their needs. However, the vital sales interactions between buyer and seller happens across companies and falls outside the domain of either companies' advanced systems.</p><br>
                    <p>
                   How might we contribute to a buying expereince that crosses the boundries between companies and brings buyers and suppliers together seamlessly? Equally, how can we respect the long standing personal relationships and competative nature of the business?  Why do buyers work with suppliers at all? We had to cast a wide net to start unpacking the implications of these early research questions. 
                    </p><br>

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Uncovering the Problems</h3>
                    <p>I created our research field guide as a system of research activities to understand and connect a wide range of stakeholders’ needs and values. From interviews about <i>why</i> divisional merchandising manager care about sell-through rates, to a contextual inquiry into <i>how</i> products are negotiated during high profile New York meetings, to analysing <i>what</i> an assistant buyer does every monday before lunch. We captured and synthesised a wide range of activities that make up the buyer's role. For more details about the retail buying process check out our full research report.</p> <br>
